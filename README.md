# Evolutionary2048
This repository contains the code for a modified 2048 game. Not only, the user can play it (changing some configurations first) but it also runs with an AI, making use of and genetic algorithm, in order to improve itself. This was created as the project for the "Evolutionary Systems applied to Robotics" subject in USP - SÃ£o Carlos.

To run the code, all the user must do is:
1) Install NetBeans
2) Install JDK version 8.0.191
3) Open the project in NetBeans
4) Have fun :)
